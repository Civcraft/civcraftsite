      PrisonPearl allows players to restrain other players (see <a href='http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg'>this infographic</a> for the basics).

Also PrisonPearl is integrated with CombatTag, logging out will not save you from being pearled.

  p Civpet allows you to un-tame animals for ownership transfer by feeding them cookies.
  p Dyncap lets us adjust the servers player cap on the fly for maximum player/performance ratio, the player cap is not actually 500 players and is subject to change while the server is live.
  p Arthropod Egg allows the use of a bane of arthropods enchanted weapon to occasionally cause mobs to drop corresponding spawn eggs. Higher level bane means higher chance of egg dropping.
  p MusterCull exists to limit the number of mobs for purposes of server performance. If you keep too many mobs in one spot (like a concentrated farm) MusterCull will target them for culling.
