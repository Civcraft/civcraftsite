      h3 Citadel
    p.
      Citadel is our protection plugin, designed to allow you to protect your buildings, doors, and chests from aggressors. It is built on the principle that protection requires resources, so to protect a block you must use any one of 3 resources: Smooth Stone, Iron, or Diamond. The more value the resource, the stronger the reinforcement.

      h3 JukeAlert
    p.
      JukeAlert lets players use jukeboxes (usually called 'snitches') to track and record the actions of other players in a small radius from the snitch. JukeAlert is integrated with Citadelâ€™s <a href='http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/'>group system</a>

      h3 PrisonPearl
    p.
      PrisonPearl allows players to restrain other players (see <a href='http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg'>this infographic</a> for the basics). Keep in mind that every day you have a player pearled consumes 2 coal from the chest, if there is not enough coal the prisoners will be freed. Also PrisonPearl is integrated with CombatTag, logging out will not save you from being pearled.

      ItemExchange allows players to set up chests and dispensers as shops. It is used in conjunction with Citadel to lock the container that is being used this way.

  p Civpet allows you to un-tame animals for ownership transfer by feeding them cookies.
  p Dyncap lets us adjust the servers player cap on the fly for maximum player/performance ratio, the player cap is not actually 500 players and is subject to change while the server is live.
  p Arthropod Egg allows the use of a bane of arthropods enchanted weapon to occasionally cause mobs to drop corresponding spawn eggs. Higher level bane means higher chance of egg dropping.
  p MusterCull exists to limit the number of mobs for purposes of server performance. If you keep too many mobs in one spot (like a concentrated farm) MusterCull will target them for culling.
