  So, after discovering the many ways in which civcraft is the best <s>Minecraft server</s> MMO in the world, you've decided to give back. Great! ttk2 always needs money for server hosting/development bounties/shipping Titan to Montreal. There are currently two ways you can donate monies: Bitcoin (translation: aNCaP diMeNZ), and PayPal. Actually there's no PayPal button right now because I couldn't get it to work, but that's okay because PayPal makes ugly buttons anyway.
